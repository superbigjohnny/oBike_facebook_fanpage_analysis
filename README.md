This is an open data analysis Demo report(HTML) for obike tw Facebook Fanpage that I did before intern interview. We can find out some interesting thing from the crowds behavior on social media and maybe some application by the result(such like finding out some popular issues on the specific groups and extend the goods that suit the issues etc.). Moreover, it can be reproduced by Weibo API and bring some brand new thought to the data analysis team.
